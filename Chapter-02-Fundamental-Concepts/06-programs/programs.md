---

## **1. Programs**

### **What Is a Program?**
- **Two Forms of Programs:**
  - **Source Code:**  
    - Human-readable text written in a programming language (e.g., C).  
    - Contains a series of statements (instructions) that describe what the program should do.
  - **Binary (Machine Code):**  
    - The compiled version of the source code, expressed in instructions that the computer's processor can execute directly.

- **Compilation & Linking:**  
  - The process of converting source code into binary machine code.
  - **Result:** The two forms are semantically equivalent (they do the same thing), but the binary is what actually runs on the computer.

- **Contrast with Scripts:**  
  - **Scripts:**  
    - Text files containing commands.
    - Directly processed by an interpreter (like a shell), without a separate compilation step.

### **Example:**
- **Source Code (C program snippet):**
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main() {
      printf("Hello, World!\n");
      return 0;
  }
  ```
- **Compiled Binary:**  
  - After running a compiler (e.g., `gcc hello.c -o hello`), you get a binary file named `hello` that you can execute.

## **2. Filters**

### **What Is a Filter?**
- A **filter** is a type of program designed to:
  - **Read input** from the standard input (stdin).
  - **Process or transform** that input.
  - **Write the output** to the standard output (stdout).

### **Why Use Filters?**
- **Modularity:**  
  - Filters allow you to build complex data processing tasks by chaining simple programs together.
- **Flexibility:**  
  - They can work with text streams, making them very useful for command-line operations.

### **Common Examples of Filters:**
- **cat:** Concatenates and displays file contents.
- **grep:** Searches for patterns within text.
- **tr:** Translates or deletes characters.
- **sort:** Sorts lines of text.
- **wc:** Counts words, lines, or characters.
- **sed:** Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
- **awk:** Pattern scanning and processing language.

### **Example Use Case:**
```bash
# Convert all lowercase letters in file.txt to uppercase using tr
cat file.txt | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
```
- Here, `cat` reads the file, and `tr` acts as a filter to change the case of the text.

## **3. Command-Line Arguments**

### **What Are Command-Line Arguments?**
- When you run a program from the command line, you can pass additional words (arguments) to it.
- These arguments provide input values or configuration parameters that the program uses when it executes.

### **Accessing Command-Line Arguments in C:**
- In C, the `main()` function can be defined to accept command-line arguments:
  ```c
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  ```
  - **`argc`**: (Argument Count) Contains the total number of command-line arguments.
  - **`argv`**: (Argument Vector) An array of strings (character pointers), where:
    - **`argv[0]`** is the name of the program.
    - **`argv[1]`**, **`argv[2]`**, etc., are the additional arguments provided.

### **Example Code:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Program Name: %s\n", argv[0]);
    if (argc > 1) {
        printf("Additional Arguments:\n");
        for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
            printf("  argv[%d]: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
        }
    } else {
        printf("No additional arguments were provided.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- **Usage:**  
  If compiled as `./program`, running:
  ```bash
  ./program arg1 arg2
  ```
  would output:
  ```
  Program Name: ./program
  Additional Arguments:
    argv[1]: arg1
    argv[2]: arg2
  ```

## **Summary**
- **Programs:** Exist as **source code** (readable text) and **binaries** (machine code).  
  - Compiling and linking convert source code into an executable binary.
- **Filters:** Special programs that read from **stdin**, process data, and write to **stdout**.  
  - Examples include `cat`, `grep`, and `sed`.
- **Command-Line Arguments:**  
  - Allow users to pass inputs to programs.
  - In C, accessed via `argc` and `argv[]` in the `main()` function.
