### **Breaking Down Connection Termination (`close()`) Simply**  

---

### **Think of Hanging Up a Phone Call 📞**  
- When you’re done talking, you **hang up**.  
- If your friend also hangs up, the **call is completely disconnected**.  
- But what if they didn’t hear your last sentence before you hung up?  
  - You **won’t know** unless they say, *“Got it!”* before you disconnect.

### **How `close()` Works in Sockets**  
- **Calling `close(sockfd)`** closes the socket connection.  
- If multiple file descriptors refer to the same socket, the **connection stays open** until all of them are closed.  

---

### **What If The Other Side Crashes or Misses Data?**  
- If you **send data and then close the socket**, you **can’t know** if the other side actually read it.  
- If their program **crashes**, the data may never be processed.  
- The **solution** is to use an **acknowledgment message** 📩 (like a "Got it!" reply) before closing.

### **Finer Control: `shutdown()` (More Precise Closing)**  
- `close()` **closes everything**.  
- But sometimes, you only want to **stop sending** data while still receiving.  
- `shutdown()` lets you close **just one side** of the connection (explained in Section 61.2).

### **Key Takeaways 🚀**  
✅ **`close()` fully disconnects a socket**.  
✅ **The connection stays open until all references (file descriptors) are closed**.  
✅ **You won’t know if the other side read your data unless you use an acknowledgment**.  
✅ **For more control, use `shutdown()` instead of `close()`**.
