## **Introduction to Sockets**

### **What are Sockets?**
- A **socket** is a method of **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** that allows applications to exchange data.  
- It can be used for communication:  
  - **Between applications on the same computer (local communication)**  
  - **Between applications on different computers connected via a network (network communication)**  

### **History of Sockets**
- First implemented in **4.2BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)** in **1983**.  
- Became widely used across **UNIX systems** and later on **other operating systems**.  

### **Standardization of Sockets**
- **POSIX.1g** formally defined the **sockets API** in **2000** (after about a decade as a draft).  
- Later, it was **superseded by SUSv3 (Single UNIX Specification Version 3)**.

## **Overview of the Following Chapters**
This chapter introduces **basic socket concepts**, while later chapters provide more details.

| Chapter | Topic |
|---------|-------|
| **Chapter 57**  | **UNIX Domain Sockets** â€“ Used for communication **within the same system**. |
| **Chapter 58** | **Networking Basics** â€“ Covers key **networking concepts** like TCP/IP. |
| **Chapter 59** | **Internet Domain Sockets** â€“ Used for communication **between different systems** over a network. |
| **Chapter 60** | **Server Design** â€“ How to create **servers using sockets**. |
| **Chapter 61** | **Advanced Topics** â€“ Detailed look at TCP, socket options, and other advanced techniques. |

## **Why Sockets Matter?**
- **Sockets programming** is a **huge field** and is critical for building:  
  - Web servers  
  - Chat applications  
  - Online multiplayer games  
  - File-sharing systems  

Even though this book covers the essentials, **entire books are dedicated** to network programming.

### **Example of How Sockets Work**
Letâ€™s take a real-world analogy:  

Imagine **two people communicating via mobile phones**:  
- One **dials** the otherâ€™s number (like a **client** requesting to connect).  
- The other person **answers** (like a **server accepting a connection**).  
- They **talk back and forth** (like **data transfer over sockets**).  
- When done, they **hang up** (closing the **connection**).  

This is how socket communication works in **network programming**.
