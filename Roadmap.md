# **How to Approach TLPI for Your Backend & Low-Level Goals**
Since you want deep knowledge of **system calls, networking, and system-level development**, focus on these key chapters in a structured manner.

---

## **📅 Roadmap for Learning from TLPI (with Projects)**
### **📖 Phase 1: Core System Programming (Weeks 1-4)**
- **Ch. 2-3:** Fundamental & System Programming Concepts  
- **Ch. 4-5, 13:** File I/O & Buffering (`open`, `read`, `write`, `lseek`, `dup`)  
- **Ch. 6:** Processes (`fork`, `exec`, `wait`)  
- **Ch. 7:** Memory Allocation (`malloc`, `brk`, `mmap`)  
- **🛠 Project:** Implement a simple **file copy (`cp`)** and a **basic shell (`execvp`)**  

### **📖 Phase 2: Signals & Process Management (Weeks 5-6)**
- **Ch. 20-22:** Signals (`kill`, `sigaction`, `alarm`, `sigsetjmp`)  
- **Ch. 23-26:** Process Control (`fork`, `waitpid`, `setpgid`)  
- **🛠 Project:** Implement a **signal handler that catches `CTRL+C`**  

### **📖 Phase 3: Threads & IPC (Weeks 7-9)**
- **Ch. 29-33:** Threads (`pthread_create`, `mutex`, `semaphores`)  
- **Ch. 43-54:** Interprocess Communication (Pipes, FIFOs, Shared Memory)  
- **🛠 Project:** Build a **multi-threaded counter** that runs on multiple cores  

### **📖 Phase 4: Networking (Weeks 10-12)**
- **Ch. 56-61:** Sockets (TCP, UDP, Client-Server Model)  
- **🛠 Project:** Build a **simple HTTP server** that handles multiple clients  

### **📖 Phase 5: Advanced Topics (Ongoing)**
- **Ch. 36-37:** Daemons  
- **Ch. 41-42:** Shared Libraries  
- **Ch. 50-51:** Virtual Memory  
- **🛠 Project:** Build a **simple proxy server with caching**

### **🚀 Why This Approach?**
1. **Structured** – You learn progressively (File I/O → Processes → IPC → Networking).  
2. **Hands-on** – Every concept has a real project to reinforce learning.  
3. **Backend Ready** – Mastering sockets, IPC, and memory management makes you a **better backend engineer**.

### **🧐 Why Were Some Chapters Skipped?**
1. **Not Critical for Backend Development:**  
   - Chapters like **Users & Groups (Ch. 8-9)**, **Login Accounting (Ch. 40)**, and **Access Control Lists (Ch. 17)** are **useful** but **not immediately necessary** for your goal.  
   - You can come back to them later when needed.  

2. **More Advanced than Necessary (For Now):**  
   - Chapters like **Extended Attributes (Ch. 16)** and **Alternative I/O Models (Ch. 63)** are **more specialized** and can be revisited later when you need them.  

3. **Can Be Learned Alongside Practical Work:**  
   - Some chapters, like **File Systems (Ch. 14)**, are more **theoretical** and are useful **if you're working on OS development** rather than backend development.  
   - If you ever work with **database internals, storage engines, or filesystems**, these will be helpful.

### **📌 Chapters You Can Learn Later (If Needed)**
If you're interested in going **deeper later**, you can explore:  

✅ **Security & Privileged Programs**  
- **Ch. 38:** Writing Secure Privileged Programs  
- **Ch. 39:** Capabilities  

✅ **Filesystem Internals**  
- **Ch. 14-15:** File Systems & Attributes  
- **Ch. 16-17:** Extended Attributes & ACLs  

✅ **Resource Management & Daemons**  
- **Ch. 34-37:** Process Groups, Scheduling, Daemons  

✅ **More Advanced Networking**  
- **Ch. 61:** Advanced Socket Topics

### **💡 Final Plan?**
For now, follow the **focused roadmap** I suggested. **Once you finish it, you can revisit skipped chapters based on what you need.**
