## **📖 System Programming Concepts**  

This chapter covers fundamental topics that are essential for **system programming** in Linux.  

🔹 **System Calls & Execution Flow ⚙️**  
   - What **system calls** are and how they interact with the kernel.  
   - The step-by-step **execution process** of a system call.  

🔹 **Library Functions vs. System Calls 📚**  
   - **Library functions** provide a higher-level interface, often **wrapping system calls**.  
   - Introduction to the **GNU C Library (glibc)** and its role in system programming.  

🔹 **Error Handling & Return Status 🚨**  
   - Every **system call & library function** must be checked for **errors**.  
   - Common **error-reporting mechanisms** and how to use them effectively.  

🔹 **Portable Programming & Standards 🌎**  
   - Understanding **feature test macros** for cross-platform compatibility.  
   - Overview of **SUSv3 (Single UNIX Specification v3) standard data types**.  

This chapter builds the **core knowledge** needed for writing **efficient, portable, and error-resilient** system programs. 🚀
