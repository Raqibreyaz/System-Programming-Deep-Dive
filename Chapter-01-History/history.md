## UNIX: History, Development & Standards

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Origins of UNIX (1969 - 1973)
- Created by **Ken Thompson** at **Bell Labs (AT&T)** on a **PDP-7** minicomputer in 1969.
- UNIX was inspired by **MULTICS**, a large multi-user OS.
- In 1973, UNIX was rewritten in **C** (by **Dennis Ritchie**), making it **portable** across different hardware.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Early Adoption & Growth (1970s - 1980s)
- AT&T couldn‚Äôt sell UNIX due to **legal restrictions**, so it distributed UNIX to universities for a small fee, including **source code**.
- **University of California, Berkeley (UCB)** played a key role in UNIX development, leading to:
  - **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)** ‚Äì an academic version of UNIX with enhancements (e.g., networking improvements).
- By **1979**, **BSD UNIX** became widespread in academia and commercial use.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Commercial Variants: System V vs. BSD (1980s)
- AT&T‚Äôs **monopoly breakup** allowed it to sell UNIX, leading to **System V UNIX**.
- Two major UNIX variants emerged:
  - **System V (AT&T)** ‚Äì commercial UNIX
  - **BSD (Berkeley)** ‚Äì open-source UNIX
- These versions influenced many modern OS implementations.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Birth of GNU/Linux (1980s - 1990s)
- **GNU Project** (Richard Stallman, 1983) aimed to create a **free UNIX-like OS**.
- By the late 1980s, GNU had most components except the **kernel**.
- In **1991**, **Linus Torvalds** developed the **Linux kernel**, inspired by **Minix** (Andrew Tanenbaum).
- **Linux**, combined with **GNU tools**, formed the **GNU/Linux operating system**, leading to rapid growth and open-source development.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Standardization of UNIX & C (1980s - 2000s)
- Due to **UNIX fragmentation**, standardization efforts emerged:
  
#### üìù C Standardization:
- **C89** (ANSI C, 1989)
- **C99** (ISO C, 1999)

#### üìú UNIX Standardization:
- **POSIX (IEEE Standard, 1988)** ‚Äì Defined UNIX system APIs.
- **Single UNIX Specification (SUS, 1990s)** ‚Äì Unified UNIX standards.
- **POSIX 1003.1-2001 & SUSv3 (2001)** ‚Äì Merged earlier UNIX standards.
- **POSIX 1003.1-2008 & SUSv4 (2008)** ‚Äì Latest UNIX standard revision.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Linux Distribution Model vs. Commercial UNIX
- Unlike **commercial UNIX** (*System V, BSD*), **Linux** has no official distribution.
- Different **Linux vendors** package their own distributions (**Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian**, etc.).
- **Linux Standard Base (LSB)** ensures compatibility across distributions.
