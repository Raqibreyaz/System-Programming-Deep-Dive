### 1️⃣ **Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion Locks)**
- Mutexes are used when multiple threads **share a resource** (like a variable, a file, or a data structure).  
- Without synchronization, two threads might **access or modify the resource at the same time**, leading to **unexpected results** (also called race conditions).  
- A **mutex ensures that only one thread** can use the resource at a time.  
- Example:  
  - Think of a **bathroom with a single key**. If one person (thread) has the key (mutex), no one else can enter until they return it.

### 2️⃣ **Condition Variables**
- Sometimes, a thread **needs to wait** for a specific event before it can proceed.  
- Instead of constantly checking (which wastes CPU power), it can **"sleep"** until another thread **signals** that the condition has changed.  
- Example:  
  - Imagine a **restaurant kitchen**. The chef (one thread) is waiting for ingredients to arrive. When the delivery person (another thread) brings the ingredients, they **wake up the chef** to start cooking.

### **Why Are These Important?**
- Without **mutexes**, multiple threads might corrupt shared data.  
- Without **condition variables**, some threads might waste time checking conditions over and over instead of efficiently waiting for updates.
