# **🔥 Mastering System Programming & Backend Development in C/C++**  

### **🚀 My Journey into Low-Level System Programming & High-Performance Backend Development**  

Welcome to my **ongoing deep dive** into **system programming and backend development** using **C**! This journey is fueled by my passion for **understanding computers at the lowest level**, mastering **networking**, and building **high-performance backend systems**.  

---

## **🎯 My Mission**  
I aim to become **proficient in system-level programming** by mastering:  
✅ **Low-Level OS Interactions** (Processes, Threads, Memory Management)  
✅ **Networking & Sockets** (TCP, UDP, UNIX Domain Sockets)  
✅ **Concurrency & Multithreading** (Pthreads, Locks, Condition Variables)  
✅ **File Systems & I/O** (Files, Pipes, Epoll, Poll, Async I/O)  
✅ **High-Performance Backend Development** (Event-Driven Architecture)  
✅ **Debugging & Profiling** (GDB, Strace, Perf)  

My ultimate goal? **To build robust, scalable, and efficient backend systems from scratch!** 💪

## **🔥 Achievements So Far**  
✅ **Custom Shell Implementation** – Built a minimalistic shell supporting commands like `cd`, `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, signal handling (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+L`).  
✅ **Multithreaded Proxy Server** – Implemented a caching web proxy with URL filtering, persistent caching, and concurrency.  
✅ **Socket Programming** – Built network applications using TCP, UDP, and UNIX domain sockets.  
✅ **Process & Signal Management** – Mastered `fork()`, `exec()`, signal handling, and inter-process communication.  
✅ **File I/O & Epoll** – Implemented efficient file operations and event-driven I/O.

## **🚀 Next Steps & Goals**  
🔹 **Deepen My Understanding of Operating Systems** (Threads, Scheduling, Virtual Memory)  
🔹 **Implement a Custom HTTP Server** (Non-blocking I/O, Multi-threading)  
🔹 **Build a Key-Value Store (Like Redis) in C**  
🔹 **Write a Mini Database Engine**  
🔹 **Optimize for Performance & Scalability**

## **💡 Why C?**  
C is the **language of the system**—it forces me to **think like the OS**, optimize for **performance**, and write **efficient** and **robust** backend applications. Mastering **C** lays a **strong foundation** for tackling **backend development, networking, and system design** at a deeper level.
